# TinyMarbles

## Inspiration
Our project inspiration comes from the popular Twitch game - Marbles. Each person gets a marble that rolls through a track, and whoeverâ€™s marble gets to the goal first wins. This is what we have set out to recreate using Tiny Graphics - a marble simulator with fully functional collisions and physics.

## Implementation
Using the TinyGraphics library, we created objects, added physics collisions, and displayed the end result.
